#Uniref test db

This is just a small slice of a late 2015 uniref90 database. The repo
includes the BLAST+ database files so you can instantly use it with blast.

Use this to test applications which start with BLAST but you don't want to wait for the full run time of a full blast run

Also has a handful of fasta files that will or won't find some results in that db
